            "content=\"The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in India has implemented several IT initiatives to streamline and enhance the efficiency of export-related processes, creating a paperless, transparent, and contactless environment. Here are the key IT initiatives of the DGFT:\\n\\n1. Online facility for e-RCMC/RC and e-Certificate of Origin (e-CoO): DGFT has developed a common digital platform for the application and issuance of electronic Registration Cum Membership Certificate (e-RCMC) and Registration Certificate (e-RC). This platform provides a convenient and secure way for exporters to apply for and manage their registrations. Additionally, the DGFT has introduced an online facility for issuing Preferential and Non-Preferential Certificates of Origin (e-CoO) with unique document identification numbers and QR codes for validation.\\n\\n2. Electronic record of export proceeds through eBRC & EDPMS:\\n   - e-BRC (Electronic Bank Realisation Certificate): This system enables DGFT to directly capture details of export proceeds realization from banks through a secure electronic mode. It has facilitated the implementation of export promotion schemes without physical interactions with stakeholders.\\n   - RBI EDPMS (Export Data Processing and Monitoring System): Developed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), this IT-based system monitors the export of goods, software, and AD bank returns. Exporters can access RBI EDPMS data through the DGFT portal.\\n\\n3. 24 X 7 Helpdesk Facility: DGFT has established a dedicated helpdesk that operates around the clock to assist exporters with online application processes and address queries related to foreign trade policies.\\n\\n4. IT Initiatives mentioned in Handbook of Procedures: Paragraph 1.04 of the Handbook of Procedures provides further details on additional IT initiatives undertaken by DGFT to improve the ease of doing business. These initiatives contribute to a paperless, transparent, and efficient environment for exporters.\\n\\n5. Online facility for Quality Control and Trade Disputes (QCTD): DGFT has created a common digital platform to handle Quality Control and Trade Disputes cases, as per Chapter 8 of the Foreign Trade Policy. This platform facilitates the resolution of disputes and ensures a fair and predictable trade environment.\\n\\n6. Importer Exporter Code (IEC) Issuance: DGFT issues the IEC in electronic form (e-IEC), and exporters can apply for it through the DGFT website.\\n\\n7. Online Monitoring of District Export Action Plans: DGFT is developing an online monitoring portal accessible through its website. This portal enables States and DGFT Regional Authorities (RAs) to upload information related to export potential products and services from each district. It also helps monitor the progress of District Export Action Plans and District Export Promotion Committee (DEPC) meetings.\\n\\n8. IT-enabled Export Promotion Activities: DGFT supports export promotion activities in districts by providing product/sector-specific training and development programs, as well as outreach activities such as buyer-seller meets, trade fairs, and workshops. These initiatives are coordinated with other departments and facilitated by DGFT RAs through DEPCs.\\n\\n9. DGFT as a Facilitator of Exports/Imports: DGFT is committed to acting as a facilitator of exports and imports, focusing on good governance and efficient, transparent, and accountable delivery systems. It regularly consults with Export Promotion Councils and Trade and Industry bodies to streamline international trade processes.\\n\\n10. Streamlining Export Processes: DGFT promotes the free passage of export consignments and discourages seizures of export-related stock, ensuring smooth manufacturing and delivery schedules for exporters.\\n\\nThese IT initiatives by DGFT reflect the organization's efforts to leverage technology for improving the ease of doing business, reducing paperwork, and enhancing transparency in foreign trade processes.\" additional_kwargs={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': 'f55c1592-fb12-401c-b637-cba86d31ff71', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 3195.0, 'output_tokens': 762.0}} response_metadata={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': 'f55c1592-fb12-401c-b637-cba86d31ff71', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 3195.0, 'output_tokens': 762.0}} id='run-17eff00a-68fc-4e0f-bfd1-ba80ecae83b9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3195, 'output_tokens': 762, 'total_tokens': 3957}\n"

Applicants can apply for the e-IEC on the DGFT website.\\n- Online Facility for e-RCMC/RC: The DGFT has created a common digital platform for the application, issuance, renewal, amendment, and related processes for the Registration Cum Membership Certificate (RCMC) and Registration Certificate (RC) issued by Registering Authorities.\\n- Online Facility for e-Certificate of Origin (e-CoO): The DGFT has established a common digital platform for issuing Preferential and Non-Preferential Certificates of Origin (e-CoO) by designated agencies. The e-CoO is issued in an online environment without physical interface, and each certificate is endorsed with a unique number and a QR code for validation and authentication.\\n- Online Facility for Quality Control and Trade Disputes (QCTD): The DGFT has developed a common digital platform for handling Quality Control and Trade Dispute cases. All jurisdictional Indian Missions abroad and Regional Authorities of DGFT are onboarded to work towards amicable dispute resolution.\\n- Electronic Record of Export Proceeds through e-BRC and EDPMS: The e-BRC (Electronic Bank Realisation Certificate) enables the DGFT to capture details of export proceeds realization directly from banks through a secure electronic mode. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has developed the EDPMS (Export Data Processing and Monitoring System) for monitoring exports and facilitating AD banks in reporting returns through a single platform. Exporters can access RBI EDPMS data on the DGFT portal.\\n- 24 X 7 Helpdesk Facility: A dedicated helpdesk facility is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to assist exporters in filing online applications on the DGFT portal and address other matters related to foreign trade policy.'"
